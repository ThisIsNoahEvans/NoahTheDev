# 100 Days of Swift Journal - Day 1

**Day 1 is completed!**

Today was very easy as I already know a bit of Swift (I have an app on the App Store!), but I definitely did learn some things. Namely, multi-line strings and how to properly use string interpolation.

It didn’t take me an hour — more like 30 minutes — but I’m happy with that, and I’m looking forward to the real challenges.

How’s everyone’s week going? It’s Friday, hurrah! Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisnoahevans) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/noahthedev), I’d love to have a chat. 

That’s it for today and I’ll see you all tomorrow — already looking forward to it!
