# 100 Days of Swift Journal - Day 2

**Day 2 completed!**

Today was a bit harder then yesterday, but I still think I did pretty well. The topics were arrays, sets, tuples, dictionaries, and enums. Definitely useful stuff, so I’ll try to remember it! I’ve been saving every lesson as a Playground so I’ll always have these to come back to, which is really nice. 
How’s everyone doing today? I’m getting quite excited as it’s my birthday on Monday, but I’ll still be taking an hour to continue with the 100 Days!
