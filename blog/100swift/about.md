# 100 Days of Swift Challenge
## Starting Friday 19th June 2020, I am taking part in [Paul Hudson's](https://twitter.com/twostraws) 100 Days of Swift, from [Hacking With Swift](https://hackingwithswift.com), which aims to teach beginners lots about Swift. In his own words:

```
This is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more, all drawn from around my existing work here on Hacking with Swift, and all designed to help you learn Swift.
Itâ€™s aimed squarely at beginners who want to learn to build real iOS apps, but struggle to find a good, free course that can help them achieve their goals.
```
