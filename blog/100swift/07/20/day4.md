# 100 Days of Swift Journal - Day 4

**Day 4 completed, finally!**
*If you're wondering what happened to Day 3...then I forgot to post about it :P*

Day Four of 100 Days Of Swift is done!
I’m excited to be picking up where I left off last month now that I have more time.

Today was about loops: three types are for, while, and repeat. This is all simple stuff as I’ve got programming expertise from not only Swift but Python as well.

How’s everyone doing at the moment? Any cool projects? I’d love to know, drop a comment below!
Have a great day and I’ll see you all tomorrow.
